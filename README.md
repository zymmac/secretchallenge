# secretchallenge
My name is Alexandre Costa and this is a Secret Challenge Project i'm working on. I have 3 weeks to conclude it and I hope that,
by then, I'll have the front-end of a website that will present the user a swimming pool equipment and accessories quote.

I'll use this Readme to explain better this project, later.

Now that it's concluded, I'll answer how and why I chose this specific project.

My father owns a small business related to swimming pool equipment, accessories and products. It is mainly directed to resellers, and rarely to final consumers. In 2016 he discussed with me that he was planning to hire a web developer to create a web store directed to final consumers. Since he didn’t have a large budget to invest, he hired a horrible developer and after about 6 months he got a dissatisfying result. It was when I stepped in.

I always have had the curiosity, and learned a bit of HTML back in 1998, when I was a kid, but did not (and still don’t) have experience to build a fully functional web store. So, I decided to pay for a web development platform, chose a nice template and started selling. It was supposed to be a low cost, low maintenance business, since the original physical business had already all structure needed, with employees, storage space, stock, etc. We had it running for about 2 years, and we learned that it was not like we were expecting.

Consumers who plan to construct a swimming pool or purchase equipment and accessories usually know nothing about which and how many products they should buy, at least in our experience. Either they expect someone to go to his property check out the swimming pool and give him a quotation, or they work for a business and were instructed to send out several e-mails to different companies and choose from the cheapest quotation. They won’t browse your web store for which products you have. The most important information they were looking for in the website was either a phone number or the e-mail address. So, my father designated an employee, trained and had her answering e-mails. Also, she had to have directly contact with the manager, because there were a many number of technical questions that she wouldn’t be able to answer herself. The business was all but self-running.

While this was going on, it had me thinking what was needed to sell pool related products like I’m used to buy things from Amazon or eBay. I concluded that the main difference is that the consumer doesn’t have the information required to choose the products by him/herself. I wished, then, that I could build a platform where the user could input few data and it would choose the products for him and let him have these added to his virtual cart. Despite having taken some programming courses, like introduction to python (from coursera.org), I had not even a slightest clue of how and which programming tools were needed to build this platform.

As I already had a full-time job, I decided it was more trouble that I was intending to get and gave up the idea. Months later my father and I decided to suspend the activities from the web store and I built (from template) for his physical business a simple webpage containing phone number and e-mail. It was mid-2018.

Unrelatedly, when I finally came to a resolution that it was time to pursue a new career and change to software engineering, I started a Udemy course, Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp, by instructor Jose Portilla. It was in January 9th of this year. I was very excited and studied a lot in my free time. In two weeks, I had finished learning the front-end part: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, DOM and jQuery – and was about to start a challenge: build a functional connect-four game using only front-end. The very same day that I started the game challenge, I received CODE’s mail.

Well, now I had a much more important challenge, so I left aside the self-paced course to dedicate myself to it. Trying to pick a particular problem, after several other ideas, it came to mind this problem my father and I had back then. That was when I realized that with the recently learned front-end tools I could probably build something similar to what I had in mind. It is always like this with knowledge, one never knows which opportunities will arise after you learn something new.

Therefore, I knew beforehand that this solution limited to front-end tools was probably not the best way to solve the problem, but it was a perfect and much more demanding opportunity to practice the recently acquired skills. Also, differently from the game challenge, I think it is an original solution to the problem faced when trying to sell pool related products online.

While I was developing it, I faced a lot of difficulties that probably could be tackled using a database and running some programming in the server-side. It was especially hard when I realized almost in the end that I was missing an important field and had to practically rebuild all the code from zero. I realize also that this code is not scalable and wouldn’t have much use other than from this specific solution. Since there isn’t a database, I had to add all products in the JavaScript code, and I have many variables globally set unnecessarily. Also, the results are displayed to the user, instead of having them automatically added to the cart.

If I had an extra week, I would spend it improving the results display, debugging some responsive issues and having it tested by friends and my father to catch bugs. Also, I would have spent time creating validations and validations alerts for wrong inputs. Finally, I would make the layout more appealing.

Now, if I had much more time, I would have had dedicated myself to the course to learn the back-end part, and then could try a much more efficient solution. I am also totally aware that there are many other tools that could help me build the best possible solution, and I look forward to start learning them. However, I had to learn quite a few useful skills to manage this challenge.

I felt the necessity to version control my work, so I was recommended by a friend to learn how to use git. Despite not understanding the full concept of git, I have pushed all my code to GitHub and set up a netlify account to have it working online. The repository is available at https://github.com/zymmac/secretchallenge. The link for the platform is https://secretchallenge.netlify.com/pool.html.

All code is mine, but I used Stack Overflow a lot for “inspirational purposes”. I have also created the pool images because I was afraid to infringe copyright issues if I used something from Google Images. The products shown are actual products from the old web store, which is not running anymore. I apologize that some of the product images contain labels in Portuguese, despite all code being made in English. I tried to use as many real information as I could to build this platform but refrained from using real brand names. Also, while I’ve consulted my father about the recommended usage of many products (for instance, it is required to add 0.5 g of chlorine for each cubic meter of water every two hours, which translates to 0.36kg / 1m³ monthly) to correctly recommend the right quantity of chlorine buckets, some attributes were invented for lack of time to research it (e.g., I know that each LED Light has a coverage area, but I didn’t go through the manufacturer’s manual to find out the specific value to each).

I hope you like it. I enjoyed a lot developing it.

Alexandre Costa
